### prettytransit for Szombathely

This timelapse visualization of Szombathely's public transit system is based on scheduling data for:

- city buses, published by [Blaguss Agora](https://blaguss-szombathely.hu/letoltheto-gtfs/), the public transit authority for Szombathely (last updated on June 29th, 2023)
- long-distance buses, published by [Vol√°nbusz](https://www.volanbusz.hu/en), a bus company that operates long-distance buses in Hungary (last published in March 2023)

It does not account for disruptions, planned construction work or public holidays.

The dataset might have inconsistencies and grossly estimated travel times of vehicles, which can sometimes make it look like they move oddly in sync.
