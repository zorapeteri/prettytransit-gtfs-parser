### prettytransit for Debrecen

This timelapse visualization of Debrecen's public transit system is based on scheduling data provided by [DERKE](https://www.derke.hu/), a volunteer association working to make public transport better in Debrecen, but not affiliated with [DKV](https://www.dkv.hu/), the official public transit authority.

It is marked as valid until August 31st, 2023, and does not account for disruptions, planned construction work or public holidays.

The dataset might have inconsistencies and grossly estimated travel times of vehicles, which can sometimes make it look like they move oddly in sync.
