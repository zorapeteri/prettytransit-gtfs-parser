### prettytransit for Szeged

This timelapse visualization of Szeged's public transit system is based on scheduling data from [an unofficial, volunteer-maintained database](https://szegedimenetrend.hu/) by developer Atilla Cseh combining the schedules of the 3 providers active in the city: [SZKT](https://szkt.hu/en/), [MÁV](https://www.mavcsoport.hu/en) and [Volánbusz](https://www.volanbusz.hu/en).

It was last updated on July 7th, 2023, and does not account for disruptions, planned construction work or public holidays.

The dataset might have inconsistencies and grossly estimated travel times of vehicles, which can sometimes make it look like they move oddly in sync.
