### prettytransit for Vienna

This timelapse visualization of Vienna's public transit system is based on:

- [scheduling data published by Wiener Linien (the public transit authority for Vienna)](https://www.vbb.de/vbb-services/api-open-data/datensaetze/) for U-Bahn, tram and bus lines (last published in February, 2022)
- [scheduling data published by Ã–BB (Austrian Federal Railways)](https://data.oebb.at/de/datensaetze~soll-fahrplan-gtfs~) for S-Bahn lines (last updated on June 29th, 2023)

These do not account for disruptions, planned construction work or public holidays.

The dataset might have inconsistencies and grossly estimated travel times of vehicles, which can sometimes make it look like they move oddly in sync.
