### prettytransit for Berlin

This timelapse visualization of Berlin's public transit system is based on weekly scheduling [data published by the VBB](https://www.vbb.de/vbb-services/api-open-data/datensaetze/), the public transit authority for Berlin-Brandenburg.

It is marked as valid from June 1st, 2023 and does not account for disruptions, planned construction work or public holidays.

The dataset might have inconsistencies and grossly estimated travel times of vehicles, which can sometimes make it look like they move oddly in sync.
