### prettytransit for Budapest

This timelapse visualization of Budapest's public transit system is based on scheduling [data published by the BKK](https://opendata.bkk.hu/data-sources), the public transit authority for Budapest.

It is marked as valid from June 6th, 2023 and does not account for disruptions, planned construction work or public holidays.

The dataset might have inconsistencies and grossly estimated travel times of vehicles, which can sometimes make it look like they move oddly in sync.
