### prettytransit for Siófok

This timelapse visualization of Siófok's public transit system is based on scheduling [data published by Volánbusz](https://www.volanbusz.hu/en), a bus company that operates long-distance and city service buses for most of Hungary.

Volánbusz has temporarily halted their publishing of public transit data since March 2023, so what you see here is the reflection of data published at that time. It does not account for disruptions, planned construction work or public holidays.

The dataset might have inconsistencies and grossly estimated travel times of vehicles, which can sometimes make it look like they move oddly in sync.
