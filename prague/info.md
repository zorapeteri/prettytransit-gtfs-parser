### prettytransit for Prague

This timelapse visualization of Prague's public transit system is based on weekly scheduling [data published by the City of Prague](https://opendata.praha.eu/).

It was last updated on July 13th, 2023, and does not account for disruptions, planned construction work or public holidays.

The dataset might have inconsistencies and grossly estimated travel times of vehicles, which can sometimes make it look like they move oddly in sync.
