### prettytransit for Bratislava

This timelapse visualization of Bratislava's public transit system is based on weekly scheduling [data published by the City of Bratislava](https://opendata.bratislava.sk/).

It is marked as valid until the end of 2023 and does not account for disruptions, planned construction work or public holidays.

The dataset might have inconsistencies and grossly estimated travel times of vehicles, which can sometimes make it look like they move oddly in sync.
