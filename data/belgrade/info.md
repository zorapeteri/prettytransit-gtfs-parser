### prettytransit for Belgrade

This timelapse visualization of Belgrade's public transit system is based on weekly scheduling [data published by the City of Belgrade](https://data.gov.rs/sr/datasets/gtfs/).

It has last been updated by the city council on March 9th, 2023, and does not account for disruptions, planned construction work or public holidays.

The dataset might have inconsistencies and grossly estimated travel times of vehicles, which can sometimes make it look like they move oddly in sync.
