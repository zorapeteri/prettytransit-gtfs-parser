### prettytransit for London

This timelapse visualization of London's public transit system is based on scheduling [data published by Transport for London](https://www.transit.land/feeds/f-gcpv-transportforlondon). It was last updated on June 29th, 2023.

For now, only Underground and River Bus (ferry) lines are available, as Transport for London does not make sufficient data public for other modes.

It does not account for disruptions, planned construction work or public holidays.

The dataset might have inconsistencies and grossly estimated travel times of vehicles, which can sometimes make it look like they move oddly in sync.
