### prettytransit for Dublin

This timelapse visualization of Dublin's public transit system is based on weekly scheduling [data published by the Transport for Ireland](https://www.transportforireland.ie/transitData/PT_Data.html).

It does not account for disruptions, planned construction work or public holidays.

Public transit in Dublin (and in Ireland in general) is overrun with private companies. This data only includes these services:

- Buses operated by Dublin Bus (including Nitelink)
- Buses operated by Go-Ahead Ireland
- Luas
- Commuter rail services operated by Iarnród Éireann

The dataset might have inconsistencies and grossly estimated travel times of vehicles, which can sometimes make it look like they move oddly in sync.
